# Watson Internet of Things

Learn how to use the Watson IoT Platform to control simulated devices.

## Getting Started

Download and follow the lab found in [lab-home-iot.pdf](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/lab-home-iot/lab-home-iot.pdf). Each section of the lab progressively adds more capability to the application. The JSON for the completed flow can be found in the file  [3-complete-flow.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/lab-home-iot/code/3-complete-flow.json).

## Analytics

Download and follow the lab found in [lab-home-iot-analytics.pdf](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/lab-home-iot/lab-home-iot-analytics.pdf) to use the Watson IoT Platform tools to send email notifications and visualize the sensor data.

## Code Snippets

HTML and JSON code used in this Node-RED tutorial is provided for your convenience in the following files:

* [1-control-led.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/lab-home-iot/code/1-control-led.json) Import this JSON into Node-RED to build the completed flow from the section titled Display a Warning on LCD Screen.
* [2-display-weather.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/lab-home-iot/code/2-display-weather.json) Import this JSON into Node-RED to build the completed flow from the section titled Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix.
* [3-complete-flow.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/lab-home-iot/code/3-complete-flow.json) Import this JSON into Node-RED to build the completed flow of this lab.
